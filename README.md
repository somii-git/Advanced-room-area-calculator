# Advanced-room-area-calculator
📐 Room Tiling Estimator

This script is designed to estimate how many whole tiles are needed to cover a rectangular room, based on an input tile size of 1 square meter.

1- It asks the user for the room's length and width in meters.

2- It calculates the room's total area.

3- Using the floor division operator (//), it determines the number of whole tiles (whole_tiles) required.

4- Using the modulo operator (%), it calculates the remaining partial area (partial_tile) that would need to be covered by cut tiles.

5- It prints the number of whole tiles needed and the size of the leftover area.
